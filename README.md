Ktor is a framework for building asynchronous server-side and client-side applications in Kotlin.

MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database. 
It is designed to store and manage large volumes of data in a flexible, scalable, and high-performance manner. 
MongoDB differs from traditional relational databases by offering a document-based data model instead of tables with rows and columns.
